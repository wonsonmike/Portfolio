      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>üë®üèº‚Äçüíª My passion for programming started in high school, when I built a Python game and tried to make it unbreakable ‚Äî that drive to build reliable, real-world solutions still fuels me today. Now, I‚Äôm a soon-to-be software engineer graduate, and I‚Äôve spent the last four years working in technical support while building up hands-on experience in Python, C++, and JavaScript. I love building easy to use programs that make people's lives easier and better.</p>
      <p>üéØ Some personal projects of mine have been building a React Native mobile app for advanced menstral cycle tracking, a custom FitBit watch face with weather and health indicators, and a variety of 2D C++ games. I'm excited to move forward in my programming career, and use my skills to build solid, enjoyable software.</p>
      <p>üåÑSome of my hobbies are exercising, video games, travelling, and being in nature.</p>
