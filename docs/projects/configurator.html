      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>This was a two week project to learn Kotlin, and make my first ever app. I want to build something basic, with some simple user interaction. I know that apps are incredibly useful, and almost every company has their own app. Knowing how to build one from scratch and improve one already built is a very useful skill.</p>
      <p>This is a very simple character creation app. In order to run the app, you'll need to either use an app emulator, such as the one built into Android Studio, or compile the app as an APK and install it on an Android device. To use the app, you simply press on the class and/or race that you want to use, and see the given stats.</p>
      <p>My purpose for creating this app was to practice the basics of app development. I wanted to build something basic, but with the potential to be improved and grown in the future.</p>
